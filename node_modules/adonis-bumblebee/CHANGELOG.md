## [Unreleased]


## [2.1.0] - 2019-12-28

### Added
 - it is now possible to define include properties in snake_case, [#67](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/67)

### Updated
 - Many dev-dependencies were updated


## [2.0.0] - 2019-03-22

The developer experience release! 

With this release, we improved the integration of Bumblebee into your
application by allowing you to pass the Transformer by name, while also
improving performance by changing the `defaultInclude` & `availableInclude`
methods to static getters. For a complete list of all changes, see the changelog
below.

An absolutely huge thank goes to [@RomainLanz], who suggested and implemented many
of the features we have in this release. Great work man! :clap:


### Breaking Changes
- The `toArray()` was renamed to `toJSON()` to be consistent with the rest of 
  the framework. 
  If you use the `toArray()` method, you should rename this it to `toJSON()`. 
  The signature and returned value remain the same. [#29]

- Changed `defaultInclude` & `availableInclude` methods to static getter for better performance. [#29]
  ```js
  // before
  class BookTransformer extends TransformerAbstract {
    defaultInclude () {
      return ['author']
    }
  }

  // after
  class BookTransformer extends TransformerAbstract {
    static get defaultInclude () {
      return ['author']
    }
  }
  ```

### Added
- Transformers can now be automatically resolved when [passed by name]. [#33]
- Multiple transform methods can be defined and used with the new [Transformer Variants] feature. [#32]
- The `Adonis/Addons/Bumblebee/TransformerAbstract` class now has an optional shorter alias to `Bumblebee/Transformer`. [#29]

### Deprecated
- The `toArray()` method was marked as deprecated. [#29]

## [1.5.2] - 2018-10-31

### Fixed
 - While refactoring a bug was introduced in the `adonis make:transformer` command that caused it to generate invalid transformers, [#26](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/pull/26) (by [@vincentducorps](https://github.com/vincentducorps))

## [1.5.0] - 2018-10-17

### Added
 - You can now generate a transformer by calling `adonis make:transformer`, [#22](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/22)

 - When an invalid transformer is passed, a better understandable error message is thrown, [#21](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/21)


## [1.4.1] - 2018-09-26

Just a small update, nothing new in this release. Just upgrading some dependencies.

### Updated
 - Updated dev-dependency japa to version 2.0.


## [1.4.0] - 2018-08-30

This maintenance release brings no new functionality, but fixes a few minor issues, updates dependencies and improves documentation and tests.

### Fixed
 - Relations that were loaded but returned null will no longer be loaded twice, [#16](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/16)

### Removed
 - Methods that were marked as deprecated have been removed in this release.


## [1.3.1] - 2018-05-01

Apart from deprecating a few methods that were only intended for internal use, this release also adds lots of code documentation.

### Deprecated
- These methods were only intended for internal use and the alias will be removed in a future release: `processIncludedResources`, `callIncludeFunction`, `figureOutWhichIncludes`, `createChildScopeFor`, `eagerloadIncludedResource`


## [1.3.0] - 2018-04-30

### Added
- Includes can now be requested with underscores and hyphens as the separator and will be converted to camelCase, [#15](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/pull/15) (by [@spamoom](https://github.com/spamoom))

### Fixed
- Ensure that pagination data is always an integer by explicitly casting `.pages` to Numbers, [#17](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/pull/17) (by [@spamoom](https://github.com/spamoom))


## [1.2.3] - 2018-04-25

### Fixed
- Model methods were not available in when using pagination because the model was passed through `toJSON`, [#14](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/pull/14) (by [@spamoom](https://github.com/spamoom))
- Fixed pagination data not getting reset when setting new data without pagination.


## [1.2.2] - 2018-03-26

### Fixed
- Lucid collection serialization still did not work as expected.


## [1.2.1] - 2018-03-26

### Fixed
- Lucid models did not get correctly serialized and null was returned.


## [1.2.0] - 2018-03-24

This update adds three new major features that did not quite make it into the initial release. Metadata and pagination are especially useful if you're building larger APIs.

### Added
- [Serializers](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee#serializers) allow you to format the data after the transformation to a standard format. 
- [Metadata](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee#metadata) are used to add extra data to the response.
- [Pagination](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee#pagination) to split large datasets into multiple parts.

### Changed
- Renamed method `data` on the transform interface to `_setData` to mark it as private. 
- Improved error handling. Exceptions now have a descriptive message that describes the problem.


## [1.1.1] - 2018-03-18

### Fixed
- Prevent an exception that occurred when an already loaded relation was eager-loaded again. 


## [1.1.0] - 2018-03-18

This release adds a few new features. Nothing too exciting but they will help you write simpler and better performing APIs.

### Added
- Relations are now automatically eager-loaded if they are a lucid model and the include method is named like the relation, [#8](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/8)
- The `transform` method can now return a primitive type, [#9](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/9)
- You can now access the `context` from within an include function through the second parameter, [#10](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/10)


## [1.0.2] - 2018-03-16

### Fixed
- Parsing includes from the request did not work as intended. Now the query parameters are parsed correctly, [#7](https://github.com/rhwilr/adonis-bumblebee/issues/7)


## [1.0.1] - 2018-03-10

### Fixed
- If null or undefined was passed to the `item` or `collection` method, an exception was thrown. Now null is returned.


## [1.0.0] - 2018-02-15

This is the first official release of adonis-bumblebee.

### Added
- The Bumblebee Fluent Interface is now available as `Adonis/Addons/Bumblebee`
- Lots of documentation


## [0.0.7] - 2018-02-10

### Fixed
- If an include function does not return an instance of `ResourceAbstrace`, the returned value is used without transformation.


## [0.0.6] - 2018-02-10

This release adds optional includes that can be requested on a per-transform basis.
It is also possible to request nested includes which are going to be recursively resolved.

### Added
- Added `availableIncludes` to transformers. 
- Added `parseIncludes()` to request includes.
- Added config values for recursion limit.
- Includes can be automatically parsed from the request parameters


## [0.0.5] - 2018-02-08

### Fixed
- Use the current request context instead of creating a new one.


## [0.0.4] - 2018-02-08

### Fixed
- Allow the transform function to be a promise


## [0.0.3] - 2018-02-08

This release is a complete rewrite.
The new architecture allows for a much more robust structure and makes it easier to add more features down the line.

### Changed
- Complete rewrite
- Import the transformer through the http context in the controller.
- Allow transformers to define `defaultIncludes` that will be appended to the result.
- 100% test coverage! :star:


## [0.0.2] - 2018-02-07

No new features. Only improvements for project management and a future release.

### Added
- Added first basic tests
- Added travis-ci integration
- Added configuration for coveralls


## [0.0.1] - 2018-01-31

Initial release to npm.
